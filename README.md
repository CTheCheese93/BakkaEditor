# What is BakkaEditor?

**BakkaEditor** is built primarily using **ReactJS** and **SlateJS**, and is a prototype of a **Knowledge Management Product** *with an alternative code name* that has no official repo, website, or publicity of any kind.

## Why Bakka?
Because I'm a bakka for thinking I could develop this alone.

## What's the point?
My friend and I both have a strong interest in **Knowledge Management**, thought to be a side effect of having ADHD and needing a solid place to dump our thoughts and keep it organized.

## Okay, but what IS BakkaEditor [going to be]?
At a glance, it could be mistaken for just a note taking application.

Everything you will be working with will be done in the form of **Pages** that you can add content into (Text, Images, Links, etc.), and as such you can make a simple list like this:

* First Item
* Second Item
* Third Item

But to take it a step further, you could turn every item on that list into it's own page that can be edited with a click of a button (or shortcut).

This would create a new page for each item and insert the text of each item as the header for the respective page. The original page that contains the list would then show the same text, but now will link back to a page.

Beyond this, we intend to setup the ability to create **views** inside of page that will allow you to filter the information that is presented.

An example of this might be if you had many pages tagged as "Task" under various categories and you created a page where you added **filter views** that listed all the tasks for a specific category.

The result? A single page that always contains an updated list of any tasks you create that are tagged as such and categorized, regardless of what page you were on when you created it.

## Can I download and use BakkaEditor?
You *could* download it and you *could* "use" it, but so long as you're looking at this repo, I doubt it will ever be in a condition for actual use.

Instead, watch the project and be on the look out for when we do begin to work on the offical product.
